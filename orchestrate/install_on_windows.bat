REM install_on_windows.bat -- one-line wrapper around install.ps1.
REM
REM Exists ONLY because .ps1 files don't double-click on Windows
REM (they open in Notepad by default). install.ps1 itself handles
REM self-elevation (UAC), running the install hidden, and tailing
REM the log back to whichever terminal launched this script. Args
REM are forwarded:
