REM run_studio.bat -- Windows runtime helper for MMT Studio. Thin
REM wrapper over run_studio.ps1 with ExecutionPolicy Bypass so the
REM operator doesn't have to unblock the .ps1.
REM
REM Usage:
REM   run_studio.bat                  (default: up + Wireshark)
REM   run_studio.bat up
REM   run_studio.bat down
REM   run_studio.bat restart
REM   run_studio.bat status
REM   run_studio.bat logs
REM   run_studio.bat wireshark
REM   run_studio.bat help
REM
REM Flags are forwarded:
REM   run_studio.bat up -NoWireshark
REM   run_studio.bat -Role tester restart
REM
REM No UAC: wsl + docker.exe work as a normal user once Docker
REM Desktop is installed.

REM Pause only on error so steady-state usage (e.g. CI scripts,
REM scheduled tasks) doesn't hang on the prompt; an error window
REM staying open lets the operator read the failure.
